We live in a radioactive world, and radiation has always been all around us as a part of our natural environment. The unit used in measuring our radiation dose is the millirem (mrem). The annual average dose per person from all natural and man-made sources is about 620 mrems. Consequently, to protect health and safety, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has established standards that allow exposures of up to 5,000 mrem per year for those who work with and around radioactive material, and 100 mrem per year for members of the public (in addition to the radiation we receive from natural background sources).
